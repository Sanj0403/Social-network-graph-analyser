# Social Network Graph Analyzer

This project analyzes a social network graph by calculating centrality measures and identifying communities within the network. Using NetworkX, this tool provides visualizations of various centrality metrics (e.g., degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector) and uses the Girvan-Newman algorithm to detect community structure.

## Features

- **Centrality Measures**: Calculates degree, betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centrality for each node in the graph.
- **Community Detection**: Identifies and visualizes communities within the network using the Girvan-Newman algorithm.
- **Graph Visualizations**: Generates two visualizations: one for centrality measures and another for community structure.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data analysis and processing.
- **NetworkX**: For network analysis and centrality calculations.
- **Matplotlib**: For graph visualization.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/social-network-graph-analyzer.git
   cd social-network-graph-analyzer
